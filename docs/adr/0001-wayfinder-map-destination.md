# Wayfinder map destination is a decisions-only IA spec for all named sections

The site's content isn't yet specified, and building it directly would mean discovering structure mid-implementation. We decided the wayfinder map's destination is a full content/information-architecture spec covering all named sections, stopping at decisions rather than pulling implementation into the map — a separate build effort executes the spec afterward. We considered scoping to a narrower first slice (e.g. Intro to AI only) but rejected it: the sections are already named and interrelated, so specifying only one risks decisions that don't hold up once the others are drafted.

Two sections can't be fully specified yet: the Frontend dev example's screenshot narrative depends on screenshots captured *while* the site is built, and Working in an existing project's screenshots are added last — both stay in the map's fog until material exists to curate.

**Amendment (2026-09-19):** the destination originally named three sections (Intro to AI, Backend dev example, Frontend dev example). A fourth, Working in an existing project, was added while resolving [the routing ticket](https://github.com/Bitaron/agentic-coding-guide/issues/4); the set is now fixed at four.
